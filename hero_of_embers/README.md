# Hero of Embers (WIP)

## About & Plans
### About
This is simple work-in-progress (WIP) console game. That I'm creating at my free time. 

### Plans
For now, the plot needs to be changed, because for now it is short, shortened, for testing purposes. Additionally, the translation of the game needs to be completed. Because for now, only about half of the texts are translated. 

Later, the code needs to be reformatted. Adding some colors, some tables, etc. 
Additionally, then the statistics system needs to be rebuilt, for both opponents and the player. 

After doing this, the combat script needs to be rebuilt, reformatted, but apart from that, it needs to be completely changed. 
I intend to add the ability to fight several enemies at once, which is currently not possible. Additionally, expanding the combat system itself, more options, etc.
