## Description
So this is some simple WIP game in console. It's fantasy RPG game. More about later. For now it's not even exported to exe. And not even some kind of click to play. If you want to test the machanics you have to start py file via main.py. But for now the plot is just scene_name.
## Plot
So the plot is YET not in the game. And of course I should first add it to game. Then add the game to github, but screw it. 

But anyway, the plot is about the hero from small village. The plot is placed long, long time ago, with knight's etc. And it's kinda drama (idk).

## Plot Writter
If you want you can make your own plot. By starting plot_maker_app.py in python. But you have to first install pyqt6. This is the only time that i used GUI.

1. So you enter the scene name. You will have to remember this because later on if you want to jump to this scene. You will need to enter the name of scene.
2. Description is to tell the player what is happening.
3. Then u click add scene. So now when scene is added you have to write the name of scene again. And now you can add options for player to make.
4. So the option value is for player for later on in the game. Player will have to enter it. So I recommend using some simple alfabet or numbers. There is no difference if it is capital letter or not. The difference will be only for player. Because he will see it if it's capitaled or not. But the mechanics of the game will any way make it small, same as the player input.
5. Description of the option is shut the text. For example "run away", "stay", "fight", etc.
6. Effect is for telling player what actually happened after he choose one of the options.
7. Requirements it is used to check if player have the items. Like imagine there is an option to eat berries. But if player doesn't have them in inventory. The option will be not avaible for player.
8. Items to give it is used for previous one. So for example as previous one if you want to give player some items that he will later on need, you have to give it to him first and this is the place that you can do it.
9. In combat is to set if there will be a fight after selecting this option or not.
10. And if there will be Enemy name is to set with what player will be fighting. (It's only working for already added enemies, you can find them in library.py file) But be carefull because the name has to be exactly right.
11. And next scene it is used to tell the game what scene will open after selecting this option (you can type the scene that is not exist YET).
12. After all of this click add option. And now on you can add as many as you want.
13. After adding all of the options. You have to click new scene at the bottom and then start it over, and over.
14. And when you are finished with the plot just simply click Save to file. After that just start the game.

## About
This is the game that I'm kinda trying to make. It's stil WIP. But I'm thinking that as a first game, it's kinda good. I mean of course i could add the GUI not just the console, but for now im happy with results.
I think that this game is about half way done. But I don't have some type of to do list and i'm thinking about the stuff that i wanted to add all the time. Like for now i just got almost all of the mechanics done.
