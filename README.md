## Description
So this is some simple WIP game in console. It's fantasy RPG game. More about later.
## Plot
So the plot is YET not in the game. And of course I should first add it to game. Then add the game to github, but screw it. 

But anyway, the plot is about the hero from small village. The plot is placed long, long time ago, with knight's etc. And it's kinda drama (idk).
## About
This is the game that I'm kinda trying to make. It's stil WIP. But I'm thinking that as a first game, it's kinda good. I mean of course i could add the GUI not just the console, but for now im happy with results.
I think that this game is about half way done. But I don't have some type of to do list and i'm thinking about the stuff that i wanted to add all the time. Like for now i just got almost all of the mechanics done.
